# Trading Strategy with TDI and Bollinger Bands Indicators

This project implements an algorithmic trading strategy designed to operate in financial markets using high-probability technical signals. The logic is based on the combination of two advanced technical indicators:

- **Super TDI (Traders Dynamic Index):** uses RSI, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands to detect buy/sell zones and momentum crossovers.
- **Super Bollinger Bands:** applies standard deviation and ATR to identify overbought/oversold zones and trend exhaustion.

## Strategy Objective

The system aims to identify high-probability entry zones by combining:
- Momentum (via TDI)
- Volatility and reversion (via Bollinger Bands)
- Visual confirmations across multiple conditions

## Entry Rules

### Buy
- TDI in buyer zone (below 50, ideally near 25 or 35)
- Green line crosses above red line on TDI
- Price touches or breaks below the lower Bollinger Band and shows rejection
- Entry confirmed as price reverses back inside the band

### Sell
- TDI in seller zone (above 50, ideally near 65 or 75)
- Green line crosses below red line on TDI
- Price touches or breaks above the upper Bollinger Band and shows rejection
- Entry confirmed as price reverses back inside the band

## Risk Management

- Avoid trades when TDI is hovering near 50 (no-trade zone)
- SL placed beyond recent swing low (for buys) or swing high (for sells)
- TP based on recent rejection zones or using 1:1 Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR)
- “Hard” signals use 2x risk compared to “Soft” signals
- Position sizes range between 0.25% to 0.50% of the account per trade

## Recommended Timeframes

- **5-minute chart:** suitable for active traders with multiple daily setups
- **1-hour chart:** better for swing trades and lower noise

## Backtest and Simulation Execution

The project allows simulation to evaluate historical performance and visualize trade behavior:

## Install Dependencies

Before running the simulations, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run a backtest using historical data:
```bash
python backtest.py
```
This uses the historical data file:
```
data/XAUUSD_1m.csv
```
and reconstructs candles minute-by-minute to evaluate the strategy and generate performance metrics.

### Replay trades visually:
```bash
python simulation_trade_replayer.py
```
This script shows how trades are opened and how they evolve as the market moves. It's useful for visually validating trade management and confirming entries/exits generated by the system.
